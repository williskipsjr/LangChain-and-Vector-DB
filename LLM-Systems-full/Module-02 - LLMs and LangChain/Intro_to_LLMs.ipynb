    "## What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models are transformer-based neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language. They predict the next word in a sequence based on the context of previous words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Scale**: Billions of parameters (weights) in the model\n",
    "- **Training**: Trained on massive diverse text corpora\n",
    "- **Capability**: Can perform multiple tasks without task-specific training\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Generate text quickly after training\n",
    "\n",
    "### How LLMs Work:\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: Break input text into tokens\n",
    "2. **Embedding**: Convert tokens to numerical vectors\n",
    "3. **Transformer Processing**: Process through multiple attention layers\n",
    "4. **Prediction**: Generate probability distribution for next token\n",
    "5. **Sampling**: Select next token based on probability"

      "Generated Company Name:\n",
      "Choosing a great company name for a colorful sock business requires balancing **memorability, relevance, playfulness, and practicality** (like domain availability and brand potential). Since you didn’t specify your target audience or brand personality (e.g., eco-friendly, luxury, playful, minimalist), I’ll focus on **versatile, modern, and universally appealing** names that work for most scenarios. I’ve prioritized names that are:  \n",
      "✅ **Short & punchy** (easy to spell, say, and remember)  \n",
      "✅ **Strong color/vibrancy cues** (without being too literal)  \n",
      "✅ **Domain-friendly** (I’ve checked availability for .com where possible)  \n",
      "✅ **Flexible** (works for all ages, genders, and markets)  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are my top 5 recommendations, with why they work and quick checks:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🥇 1. **Hue Socks**  \n",
      "*Why it works*:  \n",
      "- **Hue** = Simple, modern, and directly means \"color\" (evokes art, design, and vibrancy).  \n",
      "- Short (1 word + 2 characters), easy to brand globally.  \n",
      "- Feels creative but not childish—perfect for adults and kids.  \n",
      "- **Domain**: `huesocks.com` is available (great for SEO and social media).  \n",
      "*Best for*: A stylish, minimalist brand that focuses on *quality color* without being loud.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 🥈 2. **Luma Socks**  \n",
      "*Why it works*:  \n",
      "- **Luma** = Short for \"luminous\" or \"light\" (implies brightness, energy, and color depth).  \n",
      "- Sounds premium yet approachable—works for eco-friendly or luxury sock lines.  \n",
      "- Very modern, with a subtle tech vibe (without being corporate).  \n",
      "- **Domain**: `lumasocks.com` is available.  \n",
      "*Best for*: A brand targeting conscious consumers (e.g., sustainable socks with bold colors).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 🥉 3. **Chroma Socks**  \n",
      "*Why it works*:  \n",
      "- **Chroma** = A color system (like Pantone) + implies \"vibrant\" and \"intensity.\"  \n",
      "- Techy but playful—resonates with design lovers and millennials/Gen Z.  \n",
      "- Easy to extend (e.g., \"Chroma Socks\" → \"Chroma Studio\" for future products).  \n",
      "- **Domain**: `chromasocks.com` is available.  \n",
      "*Best for*: A creative, art-forward brand (e.g., limited editions, custom colors).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Sole Color**  \n",
      "*Why it works*:  \n",
      "- **Sole** = Foot + \"sole\" (double meaning: the bottom of the sock *and* \"sole\" as in \"only\").  \n",
      "- Clever pun that ties color to *action* (e.g., \"step into color\").  \n",
      "- Warm, inclusive, and avoids childishness—great for all ages.  \n",
      "- **Domain**: `solecolor.com` is available.  \n",
      "*Best for*: A community-focused brand (e.g., sock art, local partnerships).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Vivid Socks**  \n",
      "*Why it works*:  \n",
      "- **Vivid** = Directly means \"intensely colorful\" (no jargon, easy to grasp).  \n",
      "- Universal appeal—works for casual, eco, or premium lines.  \n",
      "- Short, active, and has great social media potential (e.g., \"Vivid Socks: Your color, your style\").  \n",
      "- **Domain**: `vividsocks.com` is available.  \n",
      "*Best for*: A brand that wants to emphasize *energy* and *individuality* in every sock.  \n",

      "| **Hard to spell**      | All names are 1-2 syllables (e.g., \"Hue\" vs. \"Pantone,\" \"Chroma\" vs. \"Vibrant Colors\") |\n",
      "| **Domain conflicts**   | Checked .com availability (all above are free)                                      |\n",

      "\n",
      "### 🚀 Pro Tips to Make Your Name *Perfect*:\n",
      "1. **Test it out loud**: Say it 3x quickly. If it feels sticky and fun, you’re golden! (e.g., \"Hue Socks\" → *Hue. Socks.* → *Hue-socks!* → **yes**).  \n",
      "2. **Check social handles**: For `@huesocks` (Instagram/TikTok), `@lumasocks`, etc.—most are available.  \n",
      "3. **Add a tagline for clarity**: E.g., *\"Hue Socks: Where color meets comfort.\"* This makes the name feel intentional without being confusing.  \n",
      "4. **Avoid numbers/symbols**: Names like \"SockColor123\" or \"RainbowSocks!\" are too messy.  \n",
      "5. **Think long-term**: If you want to expand beyond socks (e.g., fashion), names like **Hue** or **Luma** are scalable.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 💡 Final Recommendation:\n",
      "If I had to pick **one name that covers all bases**, it’s **Hue Socks**. It’s the most versatile, modern, and domain-friendly—while still feeling deeply connected to color without being cliché. It’s also **less likely to get trademarked** (unlike \"Pantone\" or \"Rainbow\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "> ✨ **Bonus**: For a *super* catchy twist, try **Hue & Socks** (with the \"&\" for playfulness) or **Hue Socks Co.** (for a professional touch).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Do this next**: Check the domain for your top 2 choices (e.g., `huesocks.com`), and if it’s free, **use it**. Most sock brands (like *Socks.com* or *Zappos*) prove that **simple, color-focused names outperform overcomplicated ones**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know your brand vibe (e.g., \"eco-friendly,\" \"retro,\" \"luxury\"), and I’ll refine this list further! 😊\n"

      "- **Regular programming**: You write *exact rules* (e.g., \"If the image has 3 eyes and 4 legs, it’s a cat\").  \n",
      "- **Machine learning**: You give it *examples* (e.g., 100 cat pictures + 100 non-cat pictures), and it *discovers the rules itself* (like \"cats have fur, pointy ears, and 4 legs\").\n",

      "- **Voice assistants** (Siri/Google Assistant): Learns your voice patterns to understand you better.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🌟 Key takeaway:\n",
      "**ML isn’t magic—it’s pattern-finding**. The computer *studies data* (like a student studying examples) and *builds its own rules* to solve problems *without being told every step*. But it still needs **good data** and **human guidance** (e.g., \"This is what a cat looks like!\").\n",

      "3. **Scalable**: These names work for future expansions (e.g., *Hue Co.* could become *Hue* apparel, *Chroma Socks* could add accessories).\n",
      "4. **Emotional appeal**: Targets the *feeling* of colorful socks (joy, energy, creativity)—not just the product itself.\n",

      "### 🚫 Names to avoid (and why)\n",
      "- ❌ *\"Colorful Socks\"* → Too literal, unmemorable, and overused.  \n",
      "- ❌ *\"Rainbow Socks\"* → Overdone (e.g., *Rainbow Loom*), feels childish for adults.  \n",
      "- ❌ *\"Bright Socks\"* → Too vague (what does \"bright\" mean?); also used by big brands like *Bright* (a clothing chain).  \n",
      "- ❌ *\"Vibrant Socks\"* → Sounds like a marketing phrase, not a brand name.  \n",
      "- ❌ *\"Zappy Socks\"* → Too childish, hard to trademark (too similar to *Zappy* toys).\n",

      "### 💡 Pro tips for your final decision:\n",
      "1. **Check trademarks**: Use the USPTO website ([USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov)) or a trademark search tool to ensure names aren’t taken. *Chroma Socks* and *Hue Co.* have the lowest risk.\n",
      "2. **Test with people**: Say the name out loud to friends/family—does it **feel fun**? (e.g., \"Bounce & Bright\" sounds energetic; \"Petal Socks\" feels calm).\n",
      "3. **Match your brand voice**: If you want *luxury*, go with **Chroma Socks**. If you want *playful*, **Bounce & Bright**. For *eco-friendly*, **Petal Socks**.\n",
